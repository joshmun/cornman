      Josh took his first job at Amazon owning the Bosch P&amp;L slice and established the business as #2 in Tools on the Amazon.ca market.
      Secretly however, he longed to marry his passion for design with something more analytically creative. On May 5th, he executed the dream and graduated from Dev Bootcamp leading a team to develop a mobile infinite side-scroller game adaptable across multiple devices.
      Today, he continues to transform semantic meaning into beautiful technology as he refines his technology stack from Ruby on Rails to React and beyond.

      Aloha! My name is Linsey and I'm an island girl from Hawai'i now residing in <em>Seattle!</em> I enjoy eating delicious food and writing code for fun consumer projects! You can catch me usually with my phone in one hand and a Starbucks drink in the other camped infront of my Macbook most of the time. The rest of the time I'm writing code from the comfort of my Costco Kirkland brand blanket and bed! Prior to coding I was working in Health Information Management and also did IT Tech Support while earning my BA in Biology. I soon found myself yearning to content create again and thus renewed my love for coding! I hope to bring together my passions for digital media, minimalistic designs, bold branding and code into a space where they can bring happiness for others. I seek to employ creativity and accountability in my code paralleled with my desire to help others find their happiness, all bundled up in an environment that continues to promote honesty and trust. These core values drive not only my work and my approach to problems but also my life.
